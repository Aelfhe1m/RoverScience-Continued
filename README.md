RoverScience REVISITED
============
****ALPHA VERSION****

Hi! I'm sort of back to do some compatibility fixes on this plugin, and to revisit some of the features as well as add a few more. Please be aware that the coming versions are not hard-tested due to my lack of time, but I /will/ be working on it as often as I can.


**UPDATED RELEASE 2.1.1**

RoverScience is a KSP plugin that attempts to add more interactive functionality to the science system FOR rovers. You drive rovers to search for *science spots* which you may then decide to investigate and analyze for science gain.

============
**[Quick Instructions]**

[1] Build your rover and attach the Rover Brain and ensure it is pointing "forward". As long as it is pointing "forward" it can be placed anywhere on your rover.

[2] Right-click on the Rover Brain in-flight and click "Activate Rover Terminal".

[3] This console will update you with information regarding the Rover Brain. Drive and explore around to search for a science spot.

[4] After driving for awhile, you may detect a potential science spot. This will be shown as a large red transparent sphere waypoint. Drive towards the waypoint to further investigate.

[5] Drive into the marker and it will turn green. You may now analyze for science, but before you do consider the potential science. Every science spot analysis will increase future science loss; be wise with which spots you wish to analyze, and which to abandon. At any point you may click on "Reset Science Spot" to begin search for another spot.

[6] This is the upgrade menu. "Current" shows you what value an upgrade currently has. "Next" will show you the value if you increase the level. "Cost" is how much you will spend in science to upgrade. "UP" is the button to upgrade. An explanation of each of the upgrades is given further below.

Notes:
- Firstly, RoverScience will not function unless the Rover Terminal is opened. This is done through the right-click menu of the Rover Brain part.
- RoverScience will only search for science spots if your vessel has at least one wheel, and that it is in contact with the ground.
- Upon landing, your rover will establish a **landing spot**. Driving farther away from where you originally landed will increase chances of finding a **science spot**.
- **Science spots** detected far away from the rover will have a bonus multiplier added to them. You are rewarded for exploring and reaching far destinations. Bear in mind that a 50% increase to 10 is only 15 -> carefully consider whether the potential (or the prediction) is worth it.
- Each analysis you commit to will slowly degrade a rover's return of science. For the first 2 analyses you'll get normal values, and anything past that will slowly degrade the amount of science you get back. Soak up those high potentials as much as possible!
- CTRL + R + S will open the RoverScience menu.
